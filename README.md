Where to find my homework in the folder named "EmployeeSQL" you will find the following:
tablesandques.sql (This contains my table script)
QuickDBD-Free Diagram.png (The image of my ERD)
Screenshot 2024-12-03 at 3.57.44â€¯PM (I took a screnshot also since the png image was a bit blurry)
QuickDBD-Free Diagram.sql (This is the code of the tables and connections from QuickDBD I included in case it was needed as well)
queryquestions.sql (These are the query questions from the Data Analysis portion)
When starting the homework I created the tables first on postgres 
I used learningAssisant to check my tables and ask questions for example when I couldn't determine what to put as my primary key or questioned when to use serial or integer and so on.
